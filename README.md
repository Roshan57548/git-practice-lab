## 📌 Git Cheatsheet

This repository contains a **quick and practical Git cheatsheet** for everyday development workflows. It covers commonly used commands for:

* 🌿 Branch creation, switching, and deletion
* 🔍 Comparing commits and viewing diffs
* 📦 Stashing and recovering work-in-progress changes
* 🔄 Rebasing branches safely
* 🛠️ Recovering lost commits using `reflog` and `reset`

The cheatsheet is designed for **fast reference**, especially during active development, debugging, or recovery scenarios.

> ⚠️ Note: Some commands (like `git reset --hard`) are destructive. Use them carefully and verify against official Git documentation when in doubt.

### Who is this for?

* Frontend & backend developers
* Full-stack engineers
* Anyone working with Git on a daily basis
